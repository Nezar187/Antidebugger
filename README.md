# AntiDebuggers.cs - Anti-Debugging and Reporting Tool

## Overview
`AntiDebuggers.cs` is a C# source code file that incorporates anti-debugging techniques, IP address retrieval, and remote reporting functionality. It is designed to detect various debugging and analysis tools commonly used in software reverse engineering and to report findings to a remote server.

## Features
- **Anti-Debugging**: Detects the presence of known debugging and reverse engineering tools on the system.
- **IP Address Retrieval**: Retrieves the public IP address of the system running the code.
- **Remote Reporting**: Sends collected data to a predefined Telegram bot, allowing for remote monitoring.

## Tools Detection
The code includes detection for various tools, including but not limited to:
- Debuggers (e.g., OllyDbg, x32dbg, x64dbg)
- Reverse Engineering Tools (e.g., dnSpy, ILSpy, de4dot)
- Network Analyzers (e.g., Wireshark, Fiddler, Charles Proxy)

## Usage
This code is intended for use in environments where the detection of debugging and analysis tools is necessary, such as in software protection or security research contexts.

## Integration
To integrate `AntiDebuggers.cs` into your project:
1. Include the file in your C# project.
2. Call the relevant methods from your code as needed.

## Warning
I did not write this code but only reverse engineered the whole project out of boredom. Use this code responsibly and ethically. Unauthorized use or integration into malicious software is illegal and against the terms of use.
