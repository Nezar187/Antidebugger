## Description
`AntiDebuggers.cs` is a C# class designed to detect and respond to debugging attempts on an application. It forms part of the iAldazAllinOne namespace and is made for applications requiring a high level of security against reverse engineering and tampering. this is a very simple file extracted from another project and perhaps something that you can start to use or implement into your project

## Usage
To use this module, include `AntiDebuggers.cs` in your C# project and instantiate the `AntiDebuggers` class. Ensure that all necessary namespaces are imported into your project.

## Requirements
- .NET Framework (compatible version with the provided code).
- Basic understanding of C# and Windows system programming.

## Functionality
- **CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent**: Utilizes PInvoke to call `kernel32.dll` for checking if the current process is being debugged.
- **GetToolip**: Retrieves the external IP address of the machine.
- **RegisteredWaitHandleAssemblyProductAttribute** & **RegisteredWaitHandleAssemblyProductAttribute2**: Methods that seem to start new threads for additional checks.
- **SizedArrayAssemblyCopyrightAttribute** & **SizedArrayAssemblyCopyrightAttribute2**: Likely involved in further anti-debugging checks.
- **Other Custom Methods**: The class includes several other methods with unclear purposes based on their names alone. These might be related to handling specific debugging scenarios or taking actions when debugging is detected.

## Examples
Include a simple instantiation of the `AntiDebuggers` class and demonstration of its primary methods.

```csharp
var antiDebugger = new AntiDebuggers();
// Example usage of methods here
```

## Warnings or Notes
- This code should be used responsibly and within the legal constraints of your region.
- Some anti-debugging techniques might trigger false positives in antivirus software.
